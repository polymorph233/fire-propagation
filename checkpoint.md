The basic feature of fire propagation game is implemented. 

Here are something that could be improved:


- Java
  - Documentation and comments
  - Use logger to accompany the program
  - Find corner cases (e.g. array index access) to enhance them
  - Rework the file open and config parsing process

- JavaScript and front-end
  - Documentation and comments
  - Current pages are ugly
  - Things are quite dirty with those setTimeout, maybe better use Promise and async/await?

- In general
  - README
  - Try to build a way to share API or design, maybe through docs
